# Air-Line-Management-System
This Kivy-based Airline Passenger Management App lets users add passengers, view available seats, and check all registered passengers. It assigns random seats and flight times while fetching real-time weather for destinations via the Open-Meteo API. The app uses SQLite for data storage and Kivy's ScreenManager for smooth navigation.
